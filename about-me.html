            </p>
                <ul>
                    He's a 5'6" Korean American with his hair occasionally styled. He's a pretty chill guy and <i>fun</i> to be around when he's not thinking too much.

                <ul>
                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>"I was created and was deemed important since my conception, therefore I was named James Han. A gift to me from my parents, a manifestation of something, an identity by which others can distinguish and categorize me apart from themselves. However, more than just a name there are many things that identify an individual. Here, through the means of written language, it is my wish to translate to you who I am in hopes of expressing humanity. We are two sides of the same coin."</i>

            </p>
                <ul>
                    He's studying programming and creating new applications to exercise his craft. He's also working part-time in an ecommerce environment managing <a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/azerogroup">Ebay</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sp?seller=A9YDUOOL7ZCPC">Amazon</a> seller accounts and communicating with customers all over the world. He recently earned a <a href="https://confirm.udacity.com/KFJARA6S">Full Stack Developer Certificate</a> from Udacity.

                <ul>
                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>"Change is the only constant, which direction it goes is up to the individual. Not diving into the wording or detail too much, truth is good and lies are evil. Truth is the only one I seek but lies are plenty to peek, wearing masks of truth to entice and ensnare. The air is filled with these invisible things. My perceived lies get filtered before they enter my lungs of perceived truth. But how do I know that they are lies or truth to begin with? Have I let lies slip through my filter and allow them to settle in my lungs, affecting the rest of my body? Am I reaping more lies because I had sown lies from the start? Has the temptations of peer advertisement and the alluring doctrines of comfortable living change my filters of truth? I aim to discover the Truth of life's troubling questions and bring to light the lies shrouded in darkness.</i>

                <a title="All things except coding" style="font-size: 5px;"> [TL;DR] </a><i>"What did James Han do before?"</i>
            </p>
                <ul>
                    Previously, he evaluated and implemented applied behavior analysis to patients at the <a href="https://www.centerforautism.com">Center for Autism and Related Disorders</a> for almost a year after completing his bachelor of science focused on integrative neuroscience at Binghamton University. He later went on to work with his brother at his brother's startup company Azerogroup.

                <ul>
                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>""</i>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                <a title="I didn't know about coding, now I love to code" style="font-size: 5px;"> [TL;DR] </a><i>What's James Han's story?</i>
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>His dad has worked with computers and the home he grew up in was filled with electronic devices. When he was 6, together with his older brother they discovered a responsive blank screen on top of an IBM desktop. Every key that was pressed on the keyboard would magically transfer onto the screen. As rewarding as that sounds, they also discovered how to boot that desktop with a floppy disc and learned to play their first game on a pc, <i>Dune 2000</i>. 
                    Fast forward a few years, and a game called Starcraft came into the picture. Virtually obsessed with the game, James and his brother would wait for the lights to turn off to play a few local games. There were days when Starcraft didn’t perform as it should and days when they were unable to play on LAN together. It was instances like these that got him thinking, "it's supposed to be working, it always has. What is going on?"
                    <p>Expecting something to work and looking forward to its result is completely normal. In fact, it's too normal that when the result does not meet the expectation it springs confusion and hidden stress. This was also known as "problem". James had two choices whenever solving problems: to figure it out with his current knowledge and know-hows, or to seek knowledge and direction from true sources. The latter almost always ends up in the problem being solved and gaining significant knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Relationships between people are more significant than the other things of this world. Why that is, was the question at hand and James researched further into this phenomena at Binghamton University, focusing on neuroscience to try to understand the psychology and the biology of why people are intrinsically drawn to each other and the value of each person thereof. Furthermore, the practicality of how to optimally fulfill that quest.</p>
                    <p>It wasn’t until much later that James came to realize that people are drawn to computers in a similar way people are drawn to other people. One reason could be the necessity of a computer to connect two people that are physically apart from each other. Another, could be because computers are becoming more anthropomorphous, taking the place of humans in terms of value and relational efficiency. With advances in general technology and artificial intelligence, this discovered phenomena is of no surprise. James recently has begun to continue his education surrounding computers and programming to stay on top and ahead of this new virtual reality and its ubiquitous impact on every life today.</p>

                <ul>
                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>I love to be around others and making everyone feel comfortable. One simple problem that I ran into, and later realized affected every relationship I've been in, was misunderstanding and miscommunication. I had resolved to find a cure and have narrowed my search into the subjects of the mind and simple math.</i>

                <a title="Dying to live, rather than living to die" style="font-size: 5px;"> [TL;DR] </a><i>What does James Han hope to accomplish?</i>
            </p>
                <ul>
                    He hopes to create applications that matter. Users that share a return on his investments, in one form or another. To better service people and strengthen existing and future relationships. He hopes to impact an individual at a time to categorically transform generations to come.

                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>Striving towards peace through the reciprocating love toward the people around us. To love and serve God and others.</i>

            <p><i>So this has been my short story on where I was, where I am heading, and where I hope to be. I look forward to sharing further additions of my story to you as I continue my journey. Thank you for allowing me to interact with you and being a part of your story.</i></p>
