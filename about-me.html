                    He's a 5'6" Korean American with his hair occasionally styled. He's a pretty chill guy and <i>fun</i> to be around when he's not thinking too much.

                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>"I was created and was deemed important since my conception, therefore I was named James Han. A gift to me from my parents, a manifestation of something, an identity by which others can distinguish and categorize me apart from themselves. However, more than just a name there are many things that identify an individual. Here, through the means of written language, it is my wish to translate to you who I am in hopes of encouragement and reciprocating effort towards the people around us in love."</i>

                <ul>
                    He's currently working part-time for Azerogroup, his brother's startup company, as an ecommerce manager. He recently earned a <a href="https://confirm.udacity.com/KFJARA6S">Full Stack Developer Certificate</a> from Udacity and while doing so acquired fundamental and present-day skills in resourcefulness, programming, and web development.

                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>"Change is the only constant, which direction it goes is up to the individual. Not diving into the wording or detail, fundamental truth is positive and lies are simply negative. Truth is what I seek but lies are plenty to peek, wearing masks of truth to entice and ensnare. The air I breathe is filled with these things. My perception of lies get filtered before they enter my lungs of perceived truth. But how do I know that the temptations of peer advertisement and the alluring doctrines of comfortable living are truths or lies to being with? Have I let lies slip through my filter and allow them to settle in my lungs, affecting the rest of my body? Am I reaping more lies because I have sowed from lies in the beginning? Being flattered and then deceived is the worst one can be. I aim to discover the Truth of life's troubling questions and bring to light the lies hiding in darkness.

            </p>
                <ul>
                    Previously, I evaluated and implemented applied behavior analysis to patients at the <a href="https://www.centerforautism.com">Center for Autism and Related Disorders</a> for almost a year after completing my bachelor of science focused on integrative neuroscience at Binghamton University. I later went on to work with my brother at his startup company AZERO (<a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/azerogroup">Ebay</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sp?seller=A9YDUOOL7ZCPC">Amazon</a>) where I interned and then transitioned into managing the Seller accounts among other tasks.

                <ul>
                    <i><p>My dad has always worked in IT so naturally I had a lot of electronic devices around the house growing up, including computers. When I was in elementary school, my brother and I would stay up until the lights turned off to play a local game of Starcraft against computers, or NPCs. There were days when Starcraft didn’t perform as it should or days my brother and I couldn’t play together on LAN. It was instances like these that nurtured my critical thinking skills to solve real life problems; it was pretty serious then. I understood that there was always an answer to a problem, it was only a matter of skillful deduction and level of relative difficulty; from the easy (the Starcraft CD needed to be cleaned) to the hard (having to install TCP/IP protocol for the computer to communicate to an interconnected device so that my brother and I could play together on LAN). My love for computers would go on into adulthood and by then I’ve encountered countless errors and problems that were not left unsolved. But the growth of a computer-related career was not in my agenda at the time as it was something I enjoyed, rather I felt the need to pursue a career in helping others in a “face-to-face” manner.</p>
                    <p>Relationships between people are significant compared to any other relationship between anything else in the world. During my time at Binghamton University, I researched further into this phenomena to try to understand the psychology and neuroscience of why people are intrinsically drawn to each other and how to optimally fulfill that interaction and the existence of both parties. This desire had led me to choose a career path in therapy to first-handedly serve and interact with others.</p>
                    <p>It wasn’t until mid-2019, when I was baffled at the understanding of another reality with its own set of laws and rules and how ubiquitous it is on every sector imaginable. This reality, called programming, presents us with the space and ability to materialize our hopes and dreams in the form of an application or client that humans will inevitably interact with. I want to utilize my knowledge in human behavior to service people and better our relationships those around us. Impacting each individual to categorically transform generations to come.</p></i>

            <p><i>So this has been my short story on where I was, where I am heading, and where I hope to be. I hope to share further additions to my story as I continue my journey. Thank you for allowing me to interact with you and being a part of your story.</i></p>
