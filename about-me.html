            </p>
                <ul>
                    He's a 2nd Gen Korean American with his hair occasionally styled. He devotes most of his time solving problems and getting to know others. He's a pretty chill guy, but at the same time not afraid to speak his mind when appropriate.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>"I was created and deemed worthy of an identity, therefore I was named James Han. A gift to me from my parents, a manifestation of something, an identity by which others can distinguish and categorize me apart from themselves and others. In addition, there are many things that identify an individual besides a name. Here, through the means of written language, it is my wish to share a part of my life with you."</i>

            </p>
                <ul>
                    He's a software engineer that loves to solve problems with a team of unique personalities and background. He's learning modern technologies as they mature and applying them to streamline his craft.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>"Being true is good while being deceptive is bad. I believe this to be objectively so in our lives. Therefore, it would make sense for us to build our lives on things that are true, on things that are good and not bad. Unfortunately, the opposition wears a mask of deception and half-truths to entice and lead astray those trying to be true. The air is filled with these invisible battles, fighting to take over our beings and mold who we are. As we mature in our perception of these things, the perceived lies get filtered before they get a chance at becoming a part of us, a part of our perceived truths. But how do we know that which enters is a lie or a truth to begin with? Have we already welcomed the deception and have allowed them to become a part of us? Are we reaping and spreading more deceptions because we had unknowingly sown a lie from the start? Are the deceptions of peer advertisement and the alluring doctrines of comfortable living polluting our filters of truth? I aim to be actively humble, so that I may be able to reevaluate the foundation on which I stand and strive to bring light to darkness.</i>

                <a title="I didn't know about code, now I love to program" style="font-size: 7px;"> TL;DR </a><i>What's James Han's story?</i>
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>Relationships, especially between people, are significant enough where individuals seek something outside of themselves to provide them meaning in this world. Whether that be physical, emotional, mental, and/or spiritual bonds. Why that is, and how to satiate the need is what James seeks to know more about.</p>
                    <p>James researched further into this phenomena at Binghamton University, focusing on neuroscience to try to understand the psychological and the biological mechanisms of why people are intrinsically drawn towards relationships, and qualify the value of every entity thereof. Thus far, he believes that each individual has been pragmatically and genetically coded to belong to and be a part of something greater than ourselves; whether that be for survival and/or purpose.</p>
                    <p>After some time, James came to realize that individuals are drawn to the responsiveness of computers in a similar way that people are drawn to other people. Computers and software are created by people to meet the needs of people. By using computers as mediums, people are inevitably tailoring computers to become anthropomorphous and enabling people to fulfill their needs, the same of how another person would, if not better and automated. And the application will keep on expanding until computers become a part of every process in life.</p>
                    <p>It's a take-and-take relationship with computers, with the consumers continuously taking. It's also a relationship where expectations are consistently met by the computer. With advances in general technology and artificial intelligence, these relationships might exponentially increase the one-sided relationship. Ironically however, behind every computer and software are individuals, or corporations, who create and meet the relational demands of others. So one can argue that the relationship might actually be a take-and-take that's flipped, where the people behind the computers are the ones who ultimately take from other people.</p>
                    <p>It comes down to people-to-people relations, and James chooses to prioritize individuals rather than the idea of it and the mediums. With this in mind, James continues to learn about computers and their relative software to be aware and stay ahead of this new virtual reality and its ubiquitous impact on relationships today, to better serve individuals. Pride and greed sets a path of selfish ambitions without the genuine regard of individuals. James believes that this path will assuredly lead to emptiness and lack of purpose and fulfillment. James is praying that he will be humble and not be deceived.</p>

                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>"I love to be around people and to encourage others in love and peace because that's all that matters in the end. One problem that I ran into and later realized that it affected every relationship I've observed, was misunderstandings and a lack of humbleness that facilitates open communication. Change starts from me, and I've resolved to develop a clear and consistent communication with those around me within the context of peace and the application of technology."</i>

            </p>
                <ul>
                    He hopes to create programs that matter. Users that share a return on his investments, in one form or another. To better service people and strengthen existing and future relationships. He hopes to impact one individual at a time to transform generations to come.
