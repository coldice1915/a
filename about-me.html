            <p>Hi! My name is James Han.</p>
            
            <p><strong><i>What do you do now?</i></strong><br>I currently work on personal projects while picking up programming skills and ideals along the way. As of October 2019, I am enrolled in <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044">Udacity’s Web Developer nanodegree</a>.</p>
            <p><strong><i>What did you do before?</i></strong><br>Previously, I evaluated and implemented applied behavior analysis to patients at the <a href="https://www.centerforautism.com">Center for Autism and Related Disorders</a> for 9 months between 2/2018 and 11/2018 after completing my bachelor’s degree in neuroscience at Binghamton University. I later went on to work with my brother at his startup company AZERO (<a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/azerogroup">Ebay</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sp?seller=A9YDUOOL7ZCPC">Amazon</a>) where I managed and optimized sales performance strategies in the electronics sector for 8 months between 11/2018 and 7/2019.</p>
            
            <p><strong><i>What's your story?</i></strong><br>My dad has always worked in IT so naturally I had a lot of electronic devices around the house growing up, including computers. When I was in elementary school, my brother and I would stay up until the lights turned off to play a local game of Starcraft against computers, or NPCs. There were days when Starcraft didn’t perform as it should or days my brother and I couldn’t play together on LAN. It was instances like these that nurtured my critical thinking skills to solve real life problems. I understood that there was always an answer to a problem, it was only a matter of skillful deduction and level of relative difficulty; from the easy (the Starcraft CD needed to be cleaned) to the hard (having to install TCP/IP protocol for the computer to communicate to an interconnected device so that my brother and I could play together on LAN). My love for computers would go on into adulthood and by then I’ve encountered countless errors and problems that were not left unsolved. But the growth of a computer-related career was not in my agenda at the time as it was something I enjoyed, rather I felt the need to pursue a career in helping others in a “face-to-face” manner.</p>
            <p>Relationships between people are significant compared to any other relationship between anything else in the world. During my time at Binghamton University, I researched further into this phenomena to try to understand the psychology and neuroscience of why people are intrinsically drawn to each other and how to optimally fulfill that interaction and the existence of both parties. This desire had led me to choose a career path in therapy to first-handedly serve and interact with others.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t until mid-2019, when I was baffled at the understanding of another reality with its own set of manmade laws and rules and how Brobdingnagian of an impact it has on every sector imaginable. This reality, called programming, presents us with the space and ability to one day materialize our hopes and dreams in the form of an application or program that humans will inevitably interact with. I want to utilize my knowledge of human behavior to service people and our relationships with others to optimize interactions thereof. Impacting individuals to categorically transform generations to come.</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>So this has been my short story on where I was and where I am heading. I hope to share further additions to my story as I continue on living. Thank you human, for allowing me to interact with you and be a part of you.</i></p>
