                <a title="Wonderfully and fearfully made" style="font-size: 5px;"> [TL;DR] </a><i>"Who's James Han?"</i>
            </p>
                <ul>
                    He's a Korean American with his hair occasionally styled. He devotes most of his time solving problems and getting to know others. He's a pretty chill guy, fun to talk with, and not afraid to speak his mind when appropriate.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>"I was created and was deemed important since my conception, therefore I was named James Han. A gift to me from my parents, a manifestation of something, an identity by which others can distinguish and categorize me apart from themselves. However, more than just a name there are many things that identify an individual. Here, through the means of written language, it is my wish to translate to you who I am in hopes of expressing humanity. We are two sides of the same coin."</i>
                </ul>

                <a title="I code and learn to code better" style="font-size: 5px;"> [TL;DR] </a><i>"What does James Han do?"</i>
            </p>
                <ul>
                    He's forever studying programming and constantly creating new applications to exercise his craft. He's working full-time automating processes and developing and implementing profitable trading algorithmns, mostly in Python.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>"Not diving into the wording or detail too much, truth is good and lies are bad. Truth is the only one I seek but lies are plenty to peek, wearing masks of truth to entice and ensnare. The air is filled with these invisible things. My perceived lies get filtered before they enter my lungs of perceived truth. But how do I know what enters is a lie or truth to begin with? Have I let lies slip through my filter and allow them to settle in my lungs, affecting the rest of my body? Am I reaping and spreading more lies because I had sown lies from the start? I aim to discover the Truth of life's troubling questions and bring to light the lies shrouded in darkness... are the temptations of peer advertisement and the alluring doctrines of comfortable living changing my filters of Truth?</i>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <a title="I didn't know about coding, now I love to code" style="font-size: 5px;"> [TL;DR] </a><i>What's James Han's story?</i>
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>His dad has worked in IT, so naturally, the home he grew up in was filled with electronic devices. When he was 6, together with his older brother they discovered a responsive blank screen on top of an IBM desktop. Every key that was pressed on the keyboard would magically transfer onto the screen. As rewarding as that sounds, they were taught how to boot that desktop with a floppy disc and learned to play their first game on a pc, <i>Dune 2000</i>.
                    Fast forward a few years, and a game called Starcraft came into the picture. Virtually obsessed with the game, James and his brother would wait for the lights to turn off just to play a few local games. There were days when Starcraft didn’t perform as it should and days when they were unable to play on LAN together. It was instances like these that got him thinking, "it's supposed to be working, it always has. What is going on?"
                    <p>Expecting something to work and looking forward to it is completely normal. In fact, it's too normal that when the results do not meet the expectation, it springs confusion and hidden stress. This was also known as "problem". People have two methods when solving an unknown problem: first, to figure it out with one's current knowledge and know-hows, or second, to seek knowledge and direction from true sources outside of oneself. When choosing the first, logically one can solve a known problem easily, but one cannot solve an unknown problem which they do not have current knowledge or means to solve the problem with, and in the end, one is left with no newfound skill. Therefore, choosing the latter will almost always end up in the problem being solved, or at least gaining or solidifying some significant knowledge along the way.</p>
                    <p>Relationships between people are more significant than any other relationships in this world. Why that is, was the question at hand and James researched further into this phenomena at Binghamton University, focusing on neuroscience to try to understand the psychological and the biological mechanisms of why people are intrinsically drawn to each other, and qualify the value of every person thereof. James' conclusion came to be, that we were designed to be "one" with each other. Meaning that each individual has been pragmatically and genetically coded to belong to and be something greater, outside of our own selves. The practicality of how to optimally fulfill that quest is what James aims to discover.</p>
                    <p>It also wasn’t until much later that James came to realize that people are drawn to computers in a similar way people are drawn to other people. One reason could be the necessity of a computer to connect two people that are physically apart from each other. Another reason could be that computers are becoming more anthropomorphous, taking the place of humans in terms of value and relational efficiency. With advances in general technology and artificial intelligence, this discovered phenomena is of no surprise. James has begun to continue his education surrounding computers to be aware and stay ahead of this new virtual reality and its ubiquitous impact on every life today.</p>

                <ul>
                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>"I love to be around others and making people feel loved and at peace because that's all that matters in the end. One simple problem that I ran into, and later realized affected every relationship I've been in, was misunderstandings and miscommunications. Change starts from me, and I've resolved to develop clear and consistent communication with those around me within the context of peace."</i>

                <a title="Dying to live, rather than living to die" style="font-size: 5px;"> [TL;DR] </a><i>What does James Han hope to accomplish?</i>
            </p>
                <ul>
                    He hopes to create applications that matter. Users that share a return on his investments, in one form or another. To better service people and strengthen existing and future relationships. He hopes to impact one individual at a time to exponentially transform generations to come.

                <ul>
                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>"Striving towards peace through the reciprocating love toward the people around us. To love and serve God and others."</i>

            <br>
            <p><i>So this has been my short story on where I was, where I am heading, and where I hope to be. I look forward to sharing further additions of my story to you as I continue my journey. Thank you for allowing me to interact with you and being a part of your story.</i></p>
