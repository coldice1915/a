            </p>
                <ul>
                    He's a 5'6" Korean American with his hair occasionally styled. He's a pretty chill guy and <i>fun</i> to be around when he's not thinking too much.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>"I was created and was deemed important since my conception, therefore I was named James Han. A gift to me from my parents, a manifestation of something, an identity by which others can distinguish and categorize me apart from themselves. However, more than just a name there are many things that identify an individual. Here, through the means of written language, it is my wish to translate to you who I am in hopes of encouragement and reciprocating effort towards the people around us in love."</i>

            </p>
                <ul>
                    He's continually studying programming and creating new applications to exercise his craft. He's also working part-time in an ecommerce environment managing <a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/azerogroup">Ebay</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sp?seller=A9YDUOOL7ZCPC">Amazon</a> seller accounts and communicating with customers all over the world. He recently earned a <a href="https://confirm.udacity.com/KFJARA6S">Full Stack Developer Certificate</a> from Udacity.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>"Change is the only constant, which direction it goes is up to the individual. Not diving into the wording or detail too much, truth is positive and lies are negative. Truth is the only one I seek but lies are plenty to peek, wearing masks of truth to entice and ensnare. The air is filled with these invisible things. My perceived lies get filtered before they enter my lungs of perceived truth. But how do I know that they are lies or truth to begin with? Have I let lies slip through my filter and allow them to settle in my lungs, affecting the rest of my body? Am I reaping more lies because I had sown lies from the start? Has the temptations of peer advertisement and the alluring doctrines of comfortable living change my filters of truth? I aim to discover the Truth of life's troubling questions and bring to light the lies shrouded in darkness.</i>

                <a title="All things except coding" style="font-size: 5px;"> [TL;DR] </a><i>"What did James Han do before?"</i>
            </p>
                <ul>
                    Previously, he evaluated and implemented applied behavior analysis to patients at the <a href="https://www.centerforautism.com">Center for Autism and Related Disorders</a> for almost a year after completing his bachelor of science focused on integrative neuroscience at Binghamton University. He later went on to work with his brother at his brother's startup company Azerogroup.

                <a title="I didn't know about coding, now I love to code" style="font-size: 5px;"> [TL;DR] </a><i>What's James Han's story?</i>
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>His dad has worked in IT so naturally he had a lot of electronic devices around the house growing up, including computers. When he was in elementary school, he and his brother would stay up until the lights turned off to play a local game of Starcraft against computers, or NPCs. There were days when Starcraft didn’t perform as it should or days when James and his brother couldn’t play together on LAN. It was instances like these that nurtured his critical thinking skills to solve real life problems; it was pretty serious then. He understood that there was always an answer to a problem, it was only a matter of skillful deduction and the level of relativity; from the easy (the Starcraft CD needed to be cleaned) to the hard (having to install TCP/IP protocol for the computer to communicate to an interconnected device so that he and his brother could play together on LAN). James's love for computers would go on into adulthood and by then he had encountered countless errors and problems that he resolved. But the growth of a computer-related career was not in his agenda at the time as it was something he enjoyed, rather he felt the need to pursue a career in helping others in a “face-to-face” manner.</p>
                    <p>Relationships between people are significant compared to any other relationship between anything else in the world. During his time at Binghamton University, he researched further into this phenomena to try to understand the psychology and neuroscience of why people are intrinsically drawn to each other and how to optimally fulfill that interaction and the existence of both parties. This desire had led me to choose a career path in therapy to first-handedly serve and interact with others.</p>
                    <p>It wasn’t until mid-2019, when he became baffled at the understanding of another reality that had its own set of laws and rules, and how ubiquitous it is on every sector of life imaginable. This reality of programming presents him with the space and ability to materialize his hopes and dreams in the form of an application or client that humans will interact with. He wants to utilize his knowledge in human behavior to service people and better existing and future relationships. Impacting each individual to categorically transform generations to come.</p>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <strong>James Han: </strong><i>I love to be around others and making everyone feel comfortable. One simple problem that I ran into, and later realized affected every relationship I've been in, was misunderstanding and miscommunication. I had resolved to find a cure and have narrowed my search into the subjects of the mind and simple math.</i>

            </p>
                <ul>
                    He wants to create applications that not only help others, but lead current and future generations toward good.
